Let me go over my notes and explain.
Now let me explain my assignment.
①First, here is the home screen.
There is a navigation bar for each. Each menu hover will show the contents of the menu. If you remove the cursor, the contents of the menu will be hidden.
The last navigation menu has a link to my assignment. There is an image gallery, a web form, and an article.
Click on the menu item you wish to review to go to that page.
②First, this is the image gallery.
There are six pictures.
The picture fits within a frame and is responsive. The photos fit within the frame in both smartphone and PC sizes.
③Next is the web form.
The name is implemented with type =text, the mail with type=mail, and the message with textarea so that many characters can be entered.
The checkbox is implemented with type=checkbox, and submit button is implemented with type=submit.
To link each label to the form, the id of the form and the for of the label are now matched.
④Next is the articles.
Each letter was coded with reference to the font-size and font bold.
